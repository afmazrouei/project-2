# project-2
This project is a Rotoscope Application that processes video frames to create artistic and visually engaging effects. The application meets all requirements for the project, featuring innovative implementations across three main categories. A prop animation (an animated bird) was dynamically added to the video frames with seamless motion and blending. Additionally, dynamic frame rotation was implemented to create a non-linear warp effect, with holes caused by transformations filled using surrounding pixels. Chromakeying was applied to replace green screen backgrounds with blue, enhanced by a garbage mask to clean up unwanted noise. Extra credit features include outlining objects in video frames for artistic enhancement and applying a dynamic warping effect on the animated bird to improve realism. The project includes suitable input and output video files, thorough documentation, and incorporates a personal appearance in the final video, demonstrating creativity and technical proficiency in video processing.
